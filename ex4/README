REMARKS:

ANSWERS:

1. No. we still could have much misses to the cache if the cache replacement algorithm dose not fit
to the running programs nature. on case it fits, it should be faster since the heap in which we store
our 'cache' will probably be saved in the computer's real cache which is much faster than general disk read.

2. If the user is using small sized memory or very local resources so there will be few deletions from
the cache the array is better (O(1) for update vs O(log(n)). on the case where the insertions and
deletions are a frequent task, the list is better (O(log(n) del&insertion vs O(n)))   

3. Better LRU: from time to time block group {A} is called allot of times and in the rest of the
time there is random access on {blocks}\{A}. the LRU will throw {A} when not in use and LFU will keep it.

 Better LFU: working on a main set of blocks {A} that fits our cache and from time to time using 
different block from {blocks}\{A} only once. the LFU will throw those occasional blocks, LRU will keep it,
and may throw a block from {A}.

 Neither: circulating by same order through set {A} that dose not fit to the cache and from time to time 
new block is added to {A}. the LRU block will always be the next wanted block,
and LFU block will be the newest block added even if its next in turn.  

4. the LRU algo needs to keep and maintain the correct time stamp for each page. and search
for it every time. but those operations is very costly. for each memory call the OS would make 
several calls only to maintain our list or search through it.

5. Probably the most efficient block size would be the actual page size used by the computer.
if it would be smaller, the computer will bring some unneeded data on each memory call.
if if it would be larger, each block miss would cause more than one page fault and again might case some unwanted data to come with the rest of the last page.
